# bbcat-orchestration-builder

Easily prototype an orchestrated audio experience that works with mobile devices from per-object audio tracks exported from a DAW and a Metadata file generated using the [S3A plugins](http://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org/plugins) (due to be released), all in one place.

This tool will wrap the packaging scripts and build process from the [bbcat-orchestration library](https://github.com/bbc/bbcat-orchestration) and the associated [user interface template](https://github.com/bbc/bbcat-orchestration-template), making it accessible in a graphical user interface.
