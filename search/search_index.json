Traditionally, audio playback has been limited to specific formats\u2014for example, stereo or five-channel surround sound, which require a fixed number of loudspeakers in defined positions. However, it's becoming more and more common for listeners to have access to a number of devices that are capable of reproducing sound, including Internet-connected devices like mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. To make the most of these loudspeakers, it's necessary to have an audio system that is adaptive and flexible. That's where audio device orchestration comes in.</p> <p>There are three key components to an orchestrated audio system.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Pairing. The system needs to know about the available devices and how to send audio to them. In our system, this is handled by sharing a pairing code\u2014a short numeric code that can be entered on a device to link it into a session. The pairing code can be embedded into a web link or shared as a QR code to make it as easy as possible to connect a device into a session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Synchronisation. The devices that are connected into a session need to be able to play the right audio at the right time. This is achieved by linking all of the devices to a synchronisation server\u2014basically, they all agree on what time it is, so they can play back sounds when they're told. Different experiences require different levels of synchronisation accuracy. For example, narration might need to play back within a second of the intended time, spot effects within tens of milliseconds, and musical elements at exactly the same time. Our synchronisation system tends to get within 10 to 200 milliseconds, depending on the playback hardware used\u2014and we also have a tool for manual calibration that can improve synchronisation between devices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Audio playback. Once devices are connected and synchronised, they need to be able to play back some sound\u2014and not necessarily the same sound on all of the devices. Object-based audio is a way of transmitting all of the different sounds that make up an experience separately so that they can be arranged in the best possible way. So if there's only one device, all sounds are played on that device. But if there are many devices, the different sounds can be spread out. How sounds are allocated to devices is up to you as the creator of an experience; Audio Orchestrator was designed to make this process as simple as possible.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you're interested in seeing what an orchestrated audio experience might look like, you can try out the various orchestrated productions that we've made (including audio drama and music). But remember, these are just a few possibilities, and the technology can be used for much more.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>We've published a large body of academic research exploring the concept of device orchestration\u2014including collaborations as part of the S3A project. If you're interested in finding out more, there are some links on blog posts here and here.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#what-is-audio-orchestrator","title":"What is Audio Orchestrator?","text":"<p>Audio Orchestrator is a production tool that lets you try out audio device orchestration with your own content. It handles the three components of an orchestrated system detailed above (pairing, synchronisation, and playback), so that you can design and build immersive and interactive audio experiences that adapt to the available devices.</p> <p>The output of this process is a prototype web application that lets listeners connect devices to listen to the content.</p> <p> The overall workflow has three steps.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create your audio files. You can create audio files however you like, or use existing files, but there are some strict requirements on how the audio is formatted before it's loaded into Audio Orchestrator.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Audio Orchestrator to build an experience. Once you've installed Audio Orchestrator, use the Home page to create a new project or load an existing one. Then work through the following steps to set up your experience.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Add different sections of content on the Sequences page\u2014anything from a single standalone section to a complex branching narrative where the listener can choose what comes next.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the ability for the listener to interact with the experience on the Controls page. The listener can make choices that affect how the audio objects are allocated to devices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide how objects should be allocated to devices on the Audio page. This is where you determine how your experience will flexibly adapt to the available devices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test out your behaviours on the Monitoring page.

Think about how listeners will consume your experience, what types of device they'll be able to connect, and what device orchestration can add to the listening experience. Having a good idea of this will make it easier to use the production tool.

If more than one device is allowed or preferred, but the object is only allowed into one device, then a random device will be selected. And this might change each time the allocation algorithm runs. Objects might even drop in and out as the available devices change.</p> <p>In certain situations, that's the desired behaviour. But if you want to encourage consistency in allocations (for example, keeping an object in the same device wherever possible), a Change management behaviour can be added. This gives the producer much greater control of exactly what happens to the objects when there is some change.</p> <p>If no Change management behaviour is applied to an object, it will be able to stop and start freely and will be allocated to any suitable devices as described above.

The manual calibration mode can help to correct for this, potentially making orchestration suitable for more experiences.</p> <ul> <li>Show Play and Pause buttons on aux devices.

The object will move to a more preferred device. If the object was already in a preferred device, and that device is still available, then it will not move.

This is intended to conserve battery and improve mobile performance, but may be undesirable for orchestrated experiences.</p> <p>The prototype application will try to keep the device awake while the browser is in the foreground; however, this is an experimental feature and not supported in all browsers.</p> <p>Device settings can also be used to prevent a phone from sleeping for as long as possible. The way to do this will vary across phones.</p> <ul> <li>On Android phones, try <code>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen timeout</code>.</li> <li>On iPhones, try <code>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Auto-Lock</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Another possibility is to design the experience in such as manner as to encourage regular interaction with the device by the listener\u2014for example, requiring them to set control values at various points during the experience. Of course, this might not work well for the type of experience that you are building.</p> <p>The audio playback isn't in sync</p> <p>The synchronisation service that we use tends to be accurate to within the region of 10 to 20 milliseconds. However, there can also be significant delays whilst the audio is processed, particularly on some mobile phones. This can result in delays of up to 200 ms or so.</p> <p>On the Appearance page of Audio Orchestrator, you can enable calibration mode\u2014this adds a tool that allows the listener to manually calibrate devices to remove this delay. See the prototype application documentation for more details.</p> <p>It's more important for some audio content to be very accurately synchronised than other content. For example, music elements are more critical than voiceover speech. If you're struggling with synchronisation problems, you might want to consider the types of sounds that are sent to the main device and any aux devices.</p> <p>It's also worth checking that you've connected all devices to the same session, rather than starting a new session on multiple devices.</p>"},{"location":"fixed-behaviours/","title":"Fixed behaviours","text":"<p>The two fixed behaviours are shown for every object.
