# Orchestrated audio productions

Audio device orchestration can be used to create interactive and immersive audio experiences for multiple connected devices. This page lists a few examples made with BBC R&D's tools.

## Pilot productions

We've released a number of pilot productions on [BBC Taster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster){: target=_blank }. Most of the following pilots are no longer available to listen to, but you can still follow the links to find out more.

** [Find out more](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2021-05-gruff-rhys-seeking-new-sounds-surround){: target=_blank }

*Seeking New Gods* is an album by musician Gruff Rhys. Gruff and the production team used *Audio Orchestrator* to create an immersive multi-device version of the album. The mix was designed for four or more devices (although the experience works with two or more). There's also a bonus track that can only be unlocked with five or more devices. [Calibration mode](prototype.md#calibration-mode) can be used to ensure that devices are accurately synchronised.

*Spectrum Sounds* is a collection of seven short pieces of music (for different colours of the spectrum) by composer Andrew Hugill. The orchestrated version allows listeners to set up and control their own listening situation by disseminating sounds (and images) across three or more connected devices. You can choose to listen with or without spoken commentary by the composer, and a written transcript is also available to view in the application.

*Pick A Part* was created by BBC R&D and the [BBC Philharmonic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/philharmonic){: target=_blank }.

It makes use of [calibration mode](prototype.md#calibration-mode) in the prototype application to make sure that the instruments are playing in time with each other.
