# Error message: audio filenames must start with a number

!!! Error "All imported audio filenames must start with a non-zero number, e.g. 01_example.wav."

    The filenames of imported audio files must start with a number, so that the audio assets can be matched to the metadata. Rename the audio files and attempt to import them again to resolve this error.
